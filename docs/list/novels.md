title: Reading List
---

Okay, I know my [watch list](./movies) is long, but you haven't seen this list. I'm lucky there isn't such a MyAnimeList for novels. Or else readtime I would have on that list. Ugh. Anyway, here's my reading list. I promise some of them are good, but don't get your hopes up. All I read is webnovels.

Don't bother about the genres and stuff. It's all action/adventure with some romance. Well, a majority of it anyway. I think it's more appropriate to put tags on each titles instead of lumping them together into a single genre.

:::warning
Excluding Lord of the Mysteries, these novels will either give you a headache or make you physically nauseaous. Please only read if you're ready for some... subpar novels. Go read The Theory of the Leisure Class or something if you're actually interested in expanding your knowledge.
