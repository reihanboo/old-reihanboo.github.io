## What is a Function

A function is relationship that maps one input to one output.
Inputs are almost exclusively $x$ as input and $y$ as output. Written as a function:

$$
\begin{equation}
y=f(x)
\end{equation}
$$

The input or $x$ is often refered to as an _independent variable_.
The output, $y$ or $f(x)$ is often refered to as a _dependent variable_.

## What Makes a Function

When you input a number, the output cannot be more than one. For example:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f(1) = 2 \\
        f(1) = 3
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

The example above means this is not a function.

# Determine a Function

## Non-function

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        y = \pm\sqrt{3-2x}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

This is _not_ a function because every input we give will always result in 2 answers because of the plus minus sign ($\pm$).

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        2x^{2}+3y^{2}=1 \\
        3y^2=2x^2+1 \\
        \frac{3y}{3}^2=\frac{2x^2}{3}+\frac{1}{3} \\
        y^2=\frac{2}{3}x^2+\frac{1}{3} \\
        \sqrt{y^2}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}x^2+\frac{1}{3}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

Ending the equation, because $\pm$ cannot exist in a function.

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        xy+2y=3x-1 \\
        y(x+2)=3x-1 \\
        \frac{y(x+2)}{x-2}=\frac{3x-1}{x-2} \\
        y=\frac{3x-1}{x-2}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

This is a function. When you input a number into $x$, a single unique output will come out.

# Evaluate a Function

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f(x)=2x+4\\
        f(3)=2(3)+4\\
        f(3)=6+4\\
        f(3)=10
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
